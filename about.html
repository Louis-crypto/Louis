                    <p>We meet drama most frequently in the theatre, on television or in the
                            cinema, and we associate it with performance, costumes , setting and
                            stages. Similarly, in school we also associate drama with script-writing, rehearsals,
                            voice production and the display of acting talent. This type of drama has
                            certain benefits to pupils d in that it increases children’s self-confidence, gives them
                            the opportunity to express themselves in public and allows them the
                            opportunity of appearing on stage.</p>

                    <p>
                        In secondary schools drama is used as a form of learning languages, as we know language comes in different types and form; ie. poetry, drama, legends, 
                        myths etc. Drama helps students be able to visualise the language they learn and its reality hence helps them to understand better what they are taught 
                        in school. Drama is also an outdoor activity and it promotes socializing among people from different backgrounds, hence promoting unity and tolerance among students from 
                        an early age. However they are some hitches the Kenya National Drama and Film Festival is trying to solve to ensure te whole festival is a fun experience and learning
                        opportunity.

                        Drama in college and university is advanced in that it now has more of film than play so as to develop talent among the youth and also so that the talented youth can learn how 
                        the kenyan film industry works, qualities and ethics that are expected of them. It majorly focuses on employing youth, promotes networking as youth studying different courses are 
                        able to meet and socialize and this increases their network hence they are able to provide opportunities for each other. Drama and Film at tertiary level also encourages learning of 
                        different cultures which promotes diversity among Kenyans hence borrowing of practices among people from different backgrounds which also promotes tolerance.
